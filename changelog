distkeys 1.1 (14.4.2015)
- creating ~/.ssh if it does not exit:
  - made sftp.stat actually wait for result, before continuing
  - fixed long standing Ruby 1.9+ compatibility issue "can't add a new
    key into hash during iteration during ssh.exec" by first completing
    sftp call and then to the ssh exec calls
- moving authorized_keys-new to authorized_keys:
  - implemented as executing mv command again now that I know how to solve
    "can't add a new key into hash during iteration during ssh.exec"
  - this is safer then the previous rm and then sftp.rename approach

distkeys 1.0 (10.10.2014)
